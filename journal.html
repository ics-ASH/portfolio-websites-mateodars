<p>Hello mr jamieson, i am currently writing my journal, this week we started unit 2 for CMU, and ive learned a lot more commands like the "def" function and how it can be useful if pasting the same thing multiple times. A main thing this unit was learning about the mouse pressing fnctions and how we can make shapes do many different things like change size, colour, opacity, rotate, ETC. </p>
