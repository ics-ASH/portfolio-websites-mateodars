<h2>Tech Tuesday #1</h2>
<p>Macbooks and chromebooks are reported to have an over repairability score than other laptops. Based on the analysis ‚ÄúFailing the Fix‚Äù, created by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), which each lappytoppie is required to go through to be sold in france. Chromebooks scored a lower repair average than the average of all other laptops. Scoring an abysmal 6.3 compared to 7.0. 

    When you look past repairability and focus on disassembly which ‚ÄúPIRG‚Äù considers to be the most important part, Chromebooks were given the score of 14.9 compared to 15.2 for other lappytoppies. In other words, chromebooks are more complicated to disassemble and simply less repairable than other leading lappytoppies.
    
    Furthermore, Apple did equally abominable, in fact it was rated the worst lappytoppie brand out of all for reparability and was the only company to score a lowly abysmal miserable repulsing D score. The lowlife Apple scored a 4.0 for disassembly, while the beautiful amazing breathtaking Asus scored a 9.1, even Lenovo, considered to be Apple's biggest competitor, scored a 6.6, portraying just how behind Apple is with their lappytoppie skills.
    
    If you put aside factors like repairing and disassembling lappytoppies the (PIRG) also took into consideration whether the manufacturers of groups that lobby against the right to repair and things like the affordability of spare parts and if repair documents are available and ready to be used. 
    
    In conclusion it seems that Apple and chromebooks have fallen behind the competition in terms of repairability, how easy it is to disassemble, and how hefty the process is in general. And we strongly suggest Apple to work on this ongoing issue with their problematic lappytoppies. ‚å®Ô∏èüñ±Ô∏èüíª</p>

<h2>Tech Tuesday #2</h2>
<p>Wall Street Journal published a report which covers an accusation that Nvidia is delaying their shipment of their data center GPU orders if they become aware of customers purchasing other AI chipmakers. ‚ÄúA lot of people that we meet with say that if Nvidia were to hear that we were meeting, they would disavow it,‚Äù Ross (the Ceo of the rival chip startup ‚ÄúGroq‚Äù) told the WSJ. the issue is these people are buying years in advance and if Nvidia were to delay shipments, customers are helpless. Additionally, the WSJ stated Nvidia is enjoying this feeling of control over the market, as an estimated 80% of companies are relying on their AI.

    In contrast to the statement from Ross, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang reportedly told analysts that he tries to be fair in allocating GPUs to companies and will avoid selling to companies that wont use the accelerators.
    
    Huang also indicated that he will introduce GPU users to cloud providers to tide them over as they wait for GPU orders to be fulfilled. Nvidia has also invested a large sum of money into a cloud company called CoreWave, and their purpose is to rent out computing power. They operate in large data centers filled to the brim with Nvidia GPUs. To put it simply, CoreWave is a GPU cloud and lends processing power.
    
    Currently Nvidia is the powerhouse of the GPU world, and it is unsure if anyone were to do anything about this issue even if they were to now about this

<h2>Tech Tuesday #3</h2>
<p>Ai also known as artificial intelligence in the form of chatbots are taking over the world by storm and becoming increasingly human to the point where it gets almost a little scary. 

    Snapchat, a very popular messaging and photo sharing app implemented their own version of an Ai chatbot and the article was written, a couple weeks prior to that, the My Ai glitched and posted a picture of what looked to be a ceiling on its story. The internet was very confused and even worried because the Ai even stopped responding to people.
    This accidental incident reminds us that Ai‚Äôs are becoming increasingly similar to humans and that managing their growth might get harder over time as they continue to rapidly develop. 
    Since ChatGPT has burst onto the global scene, even at the time that this article was being written there was an Ai that would give sentence completion possibilities for the author which shows how alike they think to humans. 
    
    Other than just writing there are also generative tools, such as image generators and voice generators. These computation models are built in LLM which stand for Large Language Models. They analyze the relationships between billions of words, sentences and paragraphs to predict what has to happen if given a specific instruction. The co-founder of OpenAi, Ilya Sutskever put it in other words that LLM‚Äôs are ‚Äújust a really, really good next-word predictor.‚Äù
    These LLM ai‚Äôs can be fine tuned by humans

<h2>Tech Tuesday #4</h2>
<p>A blockchain is a distributed ledger or database that is shared amongst a network of computers.
    They‚Äôre most commonly or well known for the role that they play in cryptocurrency systems because of their ability to make the records of transactions decentralized and secured, but they aren't strictly used in cryptocurrency. Blockchains can also be used to make data in any industry immutable. Immutable is the term to describe things that are not changeable, or aren't able to be altered.
    
    In the case of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies, transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone which underlines the point that they are shared amongst a network of computers. Upon making the initial transaction, the data entered is irreversible.
    
    Blockchains  can be used to hold data, and is most known for its inability to be altered, since there's no way to change a block, the only trust needed is inputting the data. This eliminates the need for third party security which are also humans that will cost extra money and/or make mistakes in their work. The most popular blockchain is bitcoin, bitcoins base is decentralized, therefore there is no one admin or person in control, and the responsibility is shared with the users. Since its introduction in 2009, blockchain popularity has skyrocketed. One of today's well known blockchains are NFT‚Äôs.
    
    The difference between a block chain and a typical database is the way the information is stored, the info is stored in blocks and are linked via cryptography. Decentralized blockchains, like Bitcoins, are immutable, meaning any transaction that occurred is irreversible, (because there is no singular person in control).

<h2>Tech Tuesday #5</h2>
<p>The IOT, an acronym for the more significantly known pronunciation Internet of Things, has the sole purpose of describing mechanical contraptions that operate with high levels of efficiency due to the fact that they are carefully embedded with things such as sensors, software, and other technologies as those named in order to link and bridge other devices or systems which are connected to the internet. These devices are tangible and can be almost anything imaginable such as ordinary household appliances ambient to a microwave or fridges which are implanted with sensors and software in that family to sophisticated industrial tools and things of that nature. 

    Throughout the ongoing years, IoT has evolved into one of the rare technologies that hold an immense level of significance in the 21 century. Unlocking the threshold to connect to simple, day to day objects -kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats, baby monitors, etc- to the internet's network, seamless communication has become a reality between humans, processes, and things of that nature. By the means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, all types of physical objects can distribute, and receive data information with close to none human interaction within the system. This highly concentrated hyperconnected world, opens many different pathways for digital systems to record, monitor, and tweak each interaction between other uniquely connected things. The barrier between the digital world and the physical world is fading and opening a plethora of possibilities for cooperation.
